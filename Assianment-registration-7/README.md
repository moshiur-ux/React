# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Q. Add 3 features of course registration system.

1.Waitlist Management: Waitlist management allows students to join a waitlist for courses that are already full. If a spot becomes available due to another student dropping the course, the system can automatically enroll the next student on the waitlist. This feature helps maximize course enrollment while ensuring a fair and organized process for students.
Prerequisite and Corequisite Checking:

2.The system should check and enforce course prerequisites and corequisites when students attempt to register for courses. Prerequisites are courses that students must have completed before enrolling in another course, while corequisites are courses that must be taken concurrently. This feature ensures that students have the necessary background to succeed in a course and helps them plan their schedules effectively.
Conflict Resolution and Schedule Optimization:

3.This feature assists students in building conflict-free schedules. It checks for time conflicts between courses and allows students to select alternative sections when conflicts are detected. Additionally, the system can provide schedule optimization suggestions based on students' preferences and available course options, helping them create a balanced and efficient class schedule.
These features are crucial for a Course Registration System as they enhance the registration process, ensure that students meet course requirements, and help them create conflict-free schedules. Depending on the complexity and goals of your registration system, you may also consider features like course search and filtering, registration payment processing, and integration with other academic systems.



Q. How i manage state managenment of my project 

In React, state management refers to the process of managing and maintaining the internal state (data) of a component or the application as a whole. Proper state management is crucial for building dynamic and interactive web applications. There are several ways to handle state management in React, and the choice depends on the complexity of your application and your specific requirements.

I am only following  this process, nothing else.
