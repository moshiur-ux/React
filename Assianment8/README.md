# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

3 Features are given below:

1.Developing a donation site in React DOM can offer several features to enhance user experience and manage the donation process effectively. Here are three key features commonly found in donation websites built using React:

Donation Form:

2.A user-friendly donation form is a crucial feature of any donation site. Users should be able to enter their donation amount, select a donation frequency (one-time or recurring), and provide their payment information securely.
Use React's form handling capabilities to create a dynamic and responsive donation form. Ensure that you validate user input and provide clear error messages when necessary.
User Authentication and Profiles:

3.Allow users to create accounts or log in using social media profiles or email/password. Authenticated users can view their donation history, manage recurring donations, and receive donation receipts.
Implement authentication and user profile management using React Router and state management libraries like Redux or React Context API.
Payment Processing:

4.Integration with payment gateways (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) is vital to securely process donations. Ensure that users can make payments using credit/debit cards, digital wallets, and other preferred payment methods.
Utilize React components to create a seamless payment experience. Handle payment confirmation and error handling gracefully within your React application.
Campaigns and Fundraising Goals:

Display ongoing fundraising campaigns with details, images, and progress bars showing how close they are to their fundraising goals. This can motivate donors to contribute.
Use React to build interactive campaign pages that update in real-time as new donations are made.
